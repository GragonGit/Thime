# Changelog
Welcome to the Changelog. The versioning works as follows:
- `X` is for new major features
- `Y` is for changes to existing features
- `Z` is for bug fixes and minor changes

Changes in the repository not influencing the actual application e.g. Issue Templates do not require a version change.

**Disclaimer**
I try to make changes compatible with previous version but I do not test for this. Thus, every change in this project should be treated as a breaking change.

## 0.1.0 - Setup Thime
- Initialised Thime
- Added @nuxt/eslint ‚Äì https://nuxt.com/modules/eslint
- Added @nuxt/icon ‚Äì https://nuxt.com/modules/icon

Setting up Thime and general project related things like workflows (copied over from another project) etc. I'm planning on adding more modules in the near future but these will come in future updates. The only reason these are already here is because I could select them during the creation process.

**This is the beginning of Thime!**
