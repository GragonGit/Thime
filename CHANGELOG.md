# Changelog
Welcome to the Changelog. The versioning works as follows:
- `X` is for new major features
- `Y` is for changes to existing features
- `Z` is for bug fixes and minor changes

Changes in the repository not influencing the actual application e.g. Issue Templates do not require a version change.

**Disclaimer**
I try to make changes compatible with previous version but I do not test for this. Thus, every change in this project should be treated as a breaking change.

## 0.3.0 - Created Thime Control Panel
- Created Thime control panel
- Added Material-Symbols icon pack
- Added theme functionality

Created a simple control panel for speeding up or slowing down the clock. More buttons will be coming soon. Added the Material-Symbols icon pack because I can't be bothered to do the icons myself. Lastly, added theme functionality or rather switched out the colors to use variables to allow themes in the future. It will be needed in the future and better do it now than changing everything later.

## 0.2.0 - Added Thime Logic
- Added Thime composable
- Tested insertion of Thime into debug page
- Updated dependencies

Added the logic of the Thime clock to a composable and tested its general implementation process into a debug page. Seems to work without issues and usage feels good.

## 0.1.0 - Setup Thime
- Initialised Thime
- Added @nuxt/eslint – https://nuxt.com/modules/eslint
- Added @nuxt/icon – https://nuxt.com/modules/icon

Setting up Thime and general project related things like workflows (copied over from another project) etc. I'm planning on adding more modules in the near future but these will come in future updates. The only reason these are already here is because I could select them during the creation process.

**This is the beginning of Thime!**
